  node js Role:
  
  Run Server:
  Create Server and Listen to Incoming Requests
  node js take incoming request and routes them in our code

  Business Logic:
  Handle Request, Validation Input, Connect to Database

  REPL:
  Read: Read User Input
  Eval: Evaluate User Input
  Print: PrintOutput(Result)
  Loop: Wait for new Input

  WebWorks:

HTTP,HTTPS:
Hype Text Transfer Protocal
A Protocol for Transferring Data which is understood by Browser and Server 
HTTPS: 
Hype Text Transfer Protocal Secure
HTTP + Data Encryption (during Transmission)

Core Modules:
http, https, fs, path, os

http: Launch a server ,  to send request 
https: launch a SSL server

Node js LifeCycle: 

node appjs -> start script -> parse code, register,variabes,functions
->event loop ( keeps on running as long as there are event listeners registered)

::node js uses an EVENT DRIVEN approach for all kinds of stuff
  node js execute single threaded javascript
  

  Streams & Buffers:
  buffers is simply a construct which allow you to hold multiple chunks and work with them before they are released once you done

Single Thread, Event Loop and Blocking code:
node js uses only one single javascript thread and
Thread: is basically like a process in your operating system
Event loop: is automatically started by node js when your starts 
          its Handle Event Callbacks
          its handle all Callbacks and its has certain order
          1)Timer Phase:at beginning of each new iteration its check if there abny timer callback(setTimout,setInterval callbacks)
          2nd)Pending Callbacks:and then its check other callbacks like I/O eg:(write/read file callback)
          3)Poll phase: node js look for new IO events and execute it callback
              Retrieve new I/O events excutes their callbacks 
          4)check phase: execute setImadiate() callback
          5)close Callbacks: Executes all close event callbacks
worker Pool: worker pool is responsible for all heavy lifting (eg: large file transfer)
             have different threads and 
             we have work with file,worker pool takecare and workers done and trigger callback

             event loop get terminate after ref==0


EXPRESS JS:
Why Express js?
    writing all server side logic is pretty complex so express help to write easily 
    express is all abt middleware
    def: Express is nodejs framework - add bunch of utility functions and tools and clear set of rules on how app should be built(middleware)
    its highly extensible and other packages can be plugged into it (middleware)
middleware:
  its a fucntion handle request and should call next() to forward the request to next function in line or send a response
SendFile(): to send HTML Files
    you're not limited to serving dummy text as a response
    if request is directly made for a file (eg. .css file is requested)
    you can enable static serving for such files via express.static()


MongoDB:
MongoDB stores data in flexible, JSON-like documents
MongoDB is collection of documents
The document model maps to the object in your application code, making data easy to work with  

MongoDB is a distributed Database at its core, so high availability , horizontal scaling and geographic distribution are built in and easy to use
MongoDB store data => in one document
MongoDB is a tool that create a multiple multiple database
MongoDB-> database #1
          database #1

NO SCHEMA:
 
id:1, "name":"santhana", "course":"mongoDB"
id:123, "name":"krishna", "course":"mongoDB",
id:124534, "name":"santhana",  "age":20

when data receives Database its put data into seprate instance
Mocha: is used for testing purpose

MongoDB umbrella:
 Query API, Serverless function, DB Trigger, Real Time Sync.
 https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/stitch

 MongoDB :
 CRUD 
 Create,Read,Update,Delete/Remove Operation


 start mododb 
 "C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.0\bin\mongo.exe"

 show dbs   => to show db
 use students => use is to switch db into students
db.studentData.insertOne()
db.studentData.find().pretty();
 BSON 

 Template Engines: Pug, Mustache, EJS
 Middleware function are function that have access request object(req) ,response object(res) and next() function in application request-response LifeCycle
 next function => invoked to executes the Middleware succeeding the current Middleware
 express.static function is responsile for serving static assests such as HTML files,images,etc   
 express.static(rootdir,publicfloder)
 
 MODULE: Middleware and libraries:
 body-parse: parse incoming request body in a Middleware before your handler
 compression: node.js compression Middleware
 connect-timeout: Time out a request  in express application framework
 cookie-parser: parse cookie header and populate req.cookies with an objecrt
CSRF Cross side request forgery
